# Responsive-Web-Design
This repository contains the different exercises that I am doing throughout the FreeCodeCamp Responsible Web Design course to learn the languages ​​that developers use to create web pages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

If you're interested in learning this course and many others for free, you can do so at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn
